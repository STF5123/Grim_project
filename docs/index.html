            <section><p>Jacob Grimm, (1785 - 1863), was the older brother of the duo. He was also more accomplished of the two. The major part he had in Grimm's Fairy Tales came from his editing skills.</p> <img src="images/JacobGrimm.jpg" alt="image of book cover"/></section>
            <section><p> Grimms Fairy Tales was first published in december of 1820 and contained 86 stories. By the time the seventh edition was released, the borthers had created more than 200. The brothers wre influenced by authors and lingutistics from around the world beleiving the stories represented each country.
                These stories are still passed along today and have their own sphere of influence 200 years later. These works changed the landscape of childrens fairy tales and are looked at at founding works of Western culture. The brothers also listened to opinons and morales at the time they were wrting and changed
                stories to refelect them. This was unseen at this time in most works being published. Many of thier stories have been interpereted into major fils by Disney including Snow White, LIttle Red Riding Hood, and more recently, Tangled.  </p></section>
