        <h2>Doctor Knowall</h2>
        <p>There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of
            wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two talers. When the money was being counted out
            to him, it so happened that the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well
            he ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly have been a doctor too.
            So he remained standing a while, and at length inquired if he too could not be a doctor. ‘Oh,
            yes,’ said the doctor, ‘that is soon managed.’ ‘What must I do?’ asked the peasant. ‘In the
            first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on the frontispiece; in
            the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into money, and get yourself some clothes, and
            whatsoever else pertains to medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the
            words: “I am Doctor Knowall,” and have that nailed up above your house-door.’ The peasant did
            everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored people awhile, but not long, a
            rich and great lord had some money stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in
            such and such a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had the
            horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and asked Crabb if he were Doctor
            Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was to go with him and bring back the stolen money.
            ‘Oh, yes, but Grete, my wife, must go too.’ The lord was willing, and let both of them have a
            seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came to the nobleman’s
            castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to sit down and eat. ‘Yes, but my wife,
            Grete, too,’ said he, and he seated himself with her at the table. And when the first servant
            came with a dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ‘Grete, that was the
            first,’ meaning that was the servant who brought the first dish. The servant, however, thought
            he intended by that to say: ‘That is the first thief,’ and as he actually was so, he was
            terrified, and said to his comrade outside: ‘The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he said
            I was the first.’ The second did not want to go in at all, but was forced. So when he went in
            with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ‘Grete, that is the second.’ This
            servant was equally alarmed, and he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better,
            for the peasant again said: ‘Grete, that is the third.’ The fourth had to carry in a dish that
            was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to show his skill, and guess what was
            beneath the cover. Actually, there were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what
            to say, and cried: ‘Ah, poor Crabb.’ When the lord heard that, he cried: ‘There! he knows it;
            he must also know who has the money!’</p>
        <p>On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the doctor that they wished
            him to step outside for a moment. When therefore he went out, all four of them confessed to
            him that they had stolen the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him
            a heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he did they would be
            hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was concealed. With this the doctor was
            satisfied, and returned to the hall, sat down to the table, and said: ‘My lord, now will I
            search in my book where the gold is hidden.’ The fifth servant, however, crept into the stove
            to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still and opened his A B C book,
            turned the pages backwards and forwards, and looked for the cock. As he could not find it
            immediately he said: ‘I know you are there, so you had better come out!’ Then the fellow in
            the stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out, crying: ‘That man
            knows everything!’ Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord where the money was, but did not say
            who had stolen it, and received from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned
            man.</p>
