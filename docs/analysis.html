        <h2>Analysis Of the Grimm Fairytales</h2>
        <h4>The text we used for the project was pulled from Project Gutenburg. This is a wonderful collection of over 60,000 free to use texts.</h4>
        <p>Here is the link to the Grimm text : <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2591/2591-h/2591-h.htm">Grimm Fairytales </a> and the home page of <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenburg  </a></p>

        <p>We have pulled the most used words in the following categories from the entire Grimm Document: animals, colors, and numbers.</p>
        <p>In Grimm fairy tales, and tales written by other authors, it is common to see repeating "buzzwords" in multiple tales. 
            These words can be in a number of categories, but our team found it most interesting and useful to look at a few distinct categories.
            Below, you will see three graphs made by utilizing SVG that display the information we found. To build these graphs, we used RegEx in Oxygen to find and tag all uses of 
            numbers, animals, and colors. Once everything had a tag, we could then pull up a number of how many times the words were used within the document. Using this information,
        we were able to use SVG coding to output graphs of our word analysis, seen below.</p>

        <img class="svg" src="SVGfiles/colors.svg" alt="colors bar graph"/>
        <img class="svg" src="SVGfiles/numbers.svg" alt="numbers bar graph"/>
       </div>
       </center>
        <p>We also compiled bar graphs for the top 10 verbs used in the document, and all verbs used more than 20 times.</p>
        <p>While reading any type of literature, you can see the importance of verbs used in the writing. Verbs can set the tone of a piece, and looking just at
            a list of verbs in a document can give you an interesting look at the tone and content of a work.</p>
        <p>Below are graphs of the top 20 verbs we found used in the Grimm tales, and also all verbs that were used 20 or more times.</p>
