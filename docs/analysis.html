        <h2>Analysis Of the Grimm Fairytales</h2>
        <p>The text we used for the project was pulled from Project Gutenburg. This is a wonderful collection of over 60,000 free to use texts.</p>
        <p>Here is the link to the Grimm text : <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2591/2591-h/2591-h.htm">Grimm Fairytales </a></p>

        <p>We have pulled the most used words in the following categories from the entire Grimm Document: animals, colors, and numbers.</p>
        <p>In Grimm fairy tales, and tales written by other authors, it is common to see repeating "buzzwords" in multiple tales. 
         These words can be in a number of categories, but our team found it most interesting and useful to look at a few distinct categories.
         Below, you will see three graphs made by utilizing SVG that display the information we found.</p>

        <img src="images/colors.png" alt="colors bar graph"/>
        <img src="images/Numbers.png" alt="numbers bar graph"/>
        <p>We also compiled bar graphs for the top 10 verbs used in the document, and all verbs used more than 20 times.</p>
        <p>While reading any type of literature, you can see the importance of verbs used in the writing. Verbs can set the tone of a piece, and looking just at
         a list of verbs in a document can give you an interesting look at the tone and content of a work.</p>
        <p>Below are graphs of the top 20 verbs we found used in the Grimm tales, and also all verbs that were used 20 or more times.</p>
        <img src="SVG files/bar_chartTop20.svg" alt="top 20 verbs used"/>
